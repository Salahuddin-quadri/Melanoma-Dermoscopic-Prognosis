the directory works very good
so any changes you make be sure you update the other system components that are independent,

1. I need Cosine Learning Rate Schedulers
2. I need to save the training log file along with  visuals, just like yolo has,
3. in the output, save the outputs just like yolo does, like train 1,...
4.add R² to evaluation
5. the "cls_loss_type": "weighted_bce", it return an error, check for it
