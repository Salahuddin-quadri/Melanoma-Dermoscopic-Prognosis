# Related Work: Raw Extracted Notes

## Deep Learning Approaches
- **EfficientNet, ResNet, DenseNet, CNNs, Vision Transformers (ViT, DINO)**
  - EfficientNet, ResNet50, DenseNet-121, and custom CNNs are referenced in both code and literature (see lit_riv_summaries.csv).
  - DINOv3 (self-supervised ViT) implemented in `dino_v3/` for robust feature learning; supports transfer learning and pretraining.
  - Hybrid models: combine image features (ResNet50 backbone) with structured clinical features (thickness, stage_ajcc, type) for binary classification (README, main pipeline).
  - Preprocessing includes ImageNet normalization for transfer learning.
  - Segmentation/localization (DenseNet-121 + boundary localization) noted in literature for improving thickness estimation.
  - Augmentation: Conservative and class-balanced augmentation strategies (strong for minority, light for majority) implemented in `preprocess.py`.
  - Losses: Focal Loss and Weighted BCE Loss implemented to address class imbalance (see `losses.py`).
  - Metrics: Accuracy, AUC, ROC, F1, and custom loss tracking in logs and code.

## Traditional ML Approaches
- **MLP, Random Forest, Handcrafted Features**
  - MLP and Random Forest referenced in literature (e.g., hybrid pipelines for stage classification).
  - StructuredPreprocessor in code for tabular/clinical features (z-score normalization, standardization).
  - Feature engineering: clinical features (thickness, stage_ajcc, type) included in hybrid models.

## Dataset Challenges
- **Datasets: ISIC, HAM10000, EMB, PH2, Small Proprietary**
  - ISIC and HAM10000 are primary sources for dermoscopic images (notebooks, data_inspection, README, lit_riv.csv).
  - EMB (Early Melanoma Benchmark) used for prognosis and early-stage detection.
  - Small proprietary datasets referenced in literature for thickness prediction (limitations: size, diversity).
  - Class imbalance: BEN/MEL ratio ~88/12% (data_expo.txt, code validation, README).
  - Data augmentation and class-balanced sampling to mitigate imbalance.
  - Preprocessing pipeline includes validation for thickness range, stage_ajcc, and category distribution.

## Explainable AI / Clinical Integration
- **XAI, Grad-CAM, Clinical Features, Multimodal Models**
  - XAI techniques (Grad-CAM, explainability) referenced in literature and code comments.
  - Hybrid models integrate clinical features (thickness, stage_ajcc) with image features for improved interpretability.
  - Multimodal modeling (image + tabular) supported in code and cited in related work.
  - Clinical relevance: focus on non-invasive thickness prediction, stage classification, and interpretability for clinical adoption.

## Research Gaps Motivating This Project
- Severe class imbalance in public datasets (BEN/MEL, thickness bins, stage_ajcc).
- Lack of standardized, large, diverse datasets for thickness prediction (most are small or lack full clinical metadata).
- Limited integration of clinical/tabular features with image-based models in prior work.
- Explainability and clinical interpretability are under-addressed (few works combine XAI with clinical features).
- Generalization across scanners, acquisition protocols, and populations is not well studied.
- Need for robust, reproducible pipelines that combine transfer learning, augmentation, and advanced loss functions for real-world deployment.
- Most prior works focus on binary classification (benign/malignant) rather than fine-grained thickness or stage prediction.
- Few studies benchmark ensemble, semi-supervised, or self-supervised methods (e.g., DINO, knowledge distillation) for this task.
